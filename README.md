# Cardiotocography_Classification
This machine learning solution utilizes both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers to categorize fetal health states into three distinct classes: **Normal**, **Suspect**, and **Pathological**. 

To successfully run the models included in this repository and view their outputs, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Download the Repository**: Begin by downloading the entire repository to a local directory on your computer. Ensure that all files and folders within the repository are maintained in their original structure.

2. **Prepare the Dataset**: The models in this repository require specific CSV files for data processing. Place these CSV files into a folder named `data` within the root directory of the repository. It is crucial that the folder is named exactly as `data` to avoid any file path issues during execution.

3. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure that your working directory is set to the location where the repository has been downloaded. This can be done by navigating to the repository directory in your command line interface or by setting the working directory within your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

4. **Run the Code**: With the correct folder structure and dataset in place, execute the code. The models should run smoothly and produce the expected outputs, assuming all necessary dependencies are installed.

By adhering to these instructions, you will be able to replicate the model results and further explore the codebase.
